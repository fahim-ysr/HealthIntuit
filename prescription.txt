Medical Recommendation:
1. So what I see, I presume you have some form of scalp issue, likely dandruff, which is a common condition characterized by flakes of dead skin on the scalp, it appears you have these small white or yellowish flakes scattered throughout your hair and scalp, this condition can be caused by a variety of factors including dry skin, sensitivity to hair care products, or even a fungal infection, as for remedies, I would recommend using an anti-dandruff shampoo that contains ingredients such as zinc pyrithione or ketoconazole, you can also try to reduce the frequency of washing your hair to avoid stripping it of its natural oils, and consider using a scalp massager to increase blood flow and reduce flaking, in addition to that, you may want to try an apple cider vinegar rinse to help balance the pH of your scalp and reduce flaking, and if the condition persists, I would suggest consulting a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment.
